# Course Notes for EE127 (Fall 2018)

## Syncing Notes

I will manage the uploading of each Lecture folder to Git (after I receive it from the corresponding group).

## Individual Lectures

Use the Lecture0 folder as a template for creating your notes. You should only need to modify the lecture0.tex (where 0 should be changed to the lecture you are scribing), potentially add to the refs.bib files, and potentially add to the figures folder.

## Scribe instructions

See `instructions.pdf` for detailed instructions scribes are required to follow.

## Scribing sign-up
Sign-up to scribe at the following link:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkBNu3qSNPOalyL7tkhtas8bGw32ZAge54OpX8yEM3w/edit?usp=sharing

Scribing sign-ups should hopefully stabilize during the first 2 weeks of the course. After this initial sign-up, I will freeze a version of the sign-ups sheet about two weeks after the start of the course. At this point if you cannot scribe a certain lecture it is your responsibility to find a person (or group to switch with).

You will receive .5 % extra credit on your final grade for your scribing (contingent on you generating good-quality notes).

Thanks to Max Simchowitz (and the Spring 2018 EE227C course) for the nice notes template.
