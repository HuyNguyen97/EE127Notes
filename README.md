# Course Notes for EE127 (Fall 2018)

## All Notes

I will manage the uploading of each Lecture folder to the Github.

##  Individual lectures 

Use the Lecture0 folder as a template for creating your notes. You should only need to modify the lecture0.tex (where 0 should be changed to the lecture you are scribing), potentially add to the refs.bib files, and potentially add to the figures folder.

## Scribe instructions

See `instructions.pdf` for detailed instructions scribes are required to follow.

## Scribing sign-up
Sign-up to scribe at the following link:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkBNu3qSNPOalyL7tkhtas8bGw32ZAge54OpX8yEM3w/edit?usp=sharing

Scribing sign-ups should hopefully stabilize during the first 2 weeks of the course. After this initial sign-up, I will freeze a version of the sign-ups sheet about two weeks after the start of the course. At this point if you cannot scribe a certain lecture it is your responsibility to find a person (or group to switch with).
