# Course Notes for EE127 (Fall 2018)

## All Notes

I will manage the uploading of each Lecture folder to the Github.

##  Individual lectures 

Use the Lecture0 folder as a template for creating your notes. You should only need to modify the lecture0.tex (where 0 should be changed to the lecture you are scribing), title.tex, (and potentially the refs.bib) files.

## Scribe instructions

See `instructions.pdf` for detailed instructions scribes are required to follow.
